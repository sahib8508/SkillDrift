# SkillDrift

SkillDrift is a simple project that helps students understand whether their skills are aligned with a specific career path or scattered across different domains.

The idea came from a common problem: many students keep learning random skills without knowing if they are actually building toward a job role.

## Data

The project uses manually collected job data (from sites like Naukri) and converts it into structured CSV files such as:

* skills_mapping.csv
* required_skills_per_track.csv
* city_job_counts.csv

## Why I built this

While preparing for placements, I noticed that it’s easy to learn many things but hard to stay focused on one role. This project is an attempt to make that clearer using simple data analysis.

---

## Future improvements

* Better UI
* More accurate recommendations
* Live job data instead of manual collection
* Resume-based analysis
